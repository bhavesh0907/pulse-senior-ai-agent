# Senior AI Engineer Assignment – Review Trend Intelligence Agent

### Overview
This project implements an **agentic AI system** that ingests **daily app reviews**, extracts **issues, requests, and feedback topics**, **deduplicates semantically similar topics**, and generates a **30-day rolling trend analysis report**.

The system mirrors **real-world AI product analytics pipelines** and focuses on:
- High-recall topic extraction  
- Stable topic taxonomy over time  
- Accurate frequency-based trend reporting  

Traditional topic modeling approaches (LDA, BERTopic, etc.) are deliberately avoided, as per the assignment requirements. Instead, the solution relies on **agent-based reasoning and semantic similarity**.

### Problem Statement
Given Google Play Store reviews (June 2024 → present) for a popular app (e.g., Swiggy):

- Treat **each day’s reviews as a batch**
- Extract **issues, requests, and feedback topics**
- Merge **semantically similar topics** into canonical categories
- Produce a **trend table** where:
  - Rows = Topics  
  - Columns = Dates (T-30 → T)  
  - Cells = **Frequency of topic occurrence on that date**

### Agentic Design

### 1. Review Ingestion Agent
- Ingests reviews **per day**
- Stores each batch as `YYYY-MM-DD.json`
- Ensures deterministic and reproducible processing

### 2. Topic Extraction Agent
- Extracts **short, normalized topic phrases**
- Optimized for **high recall**
- Outputs **topic → frequency** per day
- Supports:
  - Mock mode (for demos and testing)
  - Live LLM mode (when API quota is available)

### 3. Topic Deduplication & Canonicalization Agent
- Maintains a **long-lived Topic Registry**
- Uses **semantic embeddings + cosine similarity**
- Decides whether a topic should:
  - Merge into an existing canonical topic, or
  - Create a new canonical topic
- Prevents duplicate or fragmented trends across time

### 4. Trend Generator
- Aggregates canonical topic counts across days
- Produces a **30-day rolling trend matrix**
- Outputs a CSV consumable by product and analytics teams

🔹 ` ```text ` is the **important part**  
🔹 This guarantees **perfect alignment on GitHub**

## How to Run

### 1. Activate Virtual Environment
source venv/bin/activate

### 2. Run the Full Pipeline
python -m src.main

### 3. Output
The final trend report will be generated at:
output/trend_report_YYYY-MM-DD.csv


GitHub does **not** auto-convert that into a table.

You must use **Markdown table syntax** (`| |`).

## ✅ FIX — Proper Markdown Table (GitHub-rendered)

### Replace your **“Output Format” section** with this:

```markdown

### Deduplication Strategy (Key Challenge)
To handle semantically similar but differently phrased complaints (e.g.,
“delivery guy was rude” vs “delivery partner behaved badly”):

Sentence embeddings are used to compute semantic similarity

Cosine similarity determines whether topics should be merged

Canonical topics remain stable across time

Variant phrases are tracked internally in a topic registry

This approach ensures accurate trend analysis and prevents topic fragmentation.

### Mock vs Live Data
Mock mode is used for deterministic demos and quota-free execution

The architecture supports live LLM-based extraction with no structural changes

Some trend similarity is expected with synthetic data and is documented

### Assumptions
Reviews are available on a per-day basis

Each review may contain multiple topic signals

Topic frequency reflects count of mentions, not sentiment intensity

### Limitations
Mock data does not fully reflect real-world linguistic noise

No UI/dashboard (out of scope)

Ingestion is batch-based, not real-time

### Why This Approach
Aligns with real-world AI product analytics systems

Prioritizes accuracy and stability over heuristics

Explicitly solves the semantic deduplication problem highlighted in the assignment

Scales naturally to real app review data

### Conclusion
This project delivers a production-grade, agentic AI pipeline for extracting and analyzing trends from app reviews. The design emphasizes correctness, extensibility, and strict alignment with assignment requirements.
